This is an interactive piece which can function with one or more individuals present in the camera’s field of view. Every individual is masked with a changing yet somewhat static mask. However, when one individual smiles, everyones' masks are removed and the scene changes. The location of the mask is determined using facial keypoints from [Facemesh](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/facemesh) published by ml5. The piece was written using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

This piece was inspired by Espen Kluge’s work ['alternatives'](https://www.espen.xyz/alternatives-100-generative-portraits). Specifically, I was inspired by the use of geometry to reconstruct one's face. Drawing from that inspiration, random geometric shapes were used to mask the key points of the face.
